/*
shame
blame
words like these fester
and i pray, no change in seasons
i hate rain
dont let me drown in this room

lie
cheat
dont tell me secrets i cant keep
your fictions are peutride and so sweet
i'll be so naive for you

if you loved me
why couldnt you find a way
if you loved me
why shouldnt i beg for you to stay
like youre jewlery
oh havent i lost my shine
how you use me
oh how you moved me

so go
stay
something so moving
as time waits
youll come to your senses
my blind faith
keeps me so honest and true

if you loved me
then why couldnt i change your mind
if you loved me
why couldnt we try a second time
you thought you know me
but i'll never be fake like you
how you use me
how you moved me

so go 
fly
find what youve longed for your whole life
maybe youll come back a new bride
or maybe youll come back to me

i see you
i dont wanna know where youve been
i dont want to run with you
i just wanna have a life again
start a family
oh what about your mind games
if you loved me
ohhh if you love me
if loved me
